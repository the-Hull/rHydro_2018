This is the permanently citable repository (DOI: **X:Y**) that complements the supplementary material (SM) of Slater *et al.* (in prep.). 
It contains the code, additional files (e.g. images) and data to fully reproduce the tutorial, based on A. Hurley's short course contribution (cf. below). The code provided in the print/online version of the article is - while educational - mainly for illustrative purposes, and we refer the reader to this repository to fully explore and reproduce any outputs.
