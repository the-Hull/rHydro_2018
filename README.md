# Processing, modelling and vizualising hydrological data in R 

## <a name="Desc"></a> Description

This tutorial explores the use of some *tidyverse* approaches to develop a reproducible and scalable hydrological workflow. I investigate the role of catchment characteristics in controlling peak discharges. For this, I draw upon *piping*, *nesting* and *mapping* to apply a series of models and to identify the best fitting ones. Some custom functions are introduced to read in catchment descriptor data and to customize some output figures.

## <a name="Use"></a> Use

Files in this repository are intendeded to be used with the latest version of R (currently v3.5.2) as well as the latest version of RStudio (currently v1.1.463). 
To reproduce the presentation clone or download (and unzip) this repository to your local machine and open the project file **rHydro_2018.proj**. 
Navigate to and open the presentation file [**./presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz.Rmd**](https://github.com/the-Hull/rHydro_2018/blob/master/presentation/01_rHydro_AGLHurley_proc-mod-viz.Rmd). 
Lastly, click the *knit* below the tabs bar in the RStudio IDE.
