This repository contains the code, supplementary files (e.g. images) and data to reproduce the contribution of A. Hurley at the shourt course
held at EGU 2018 in Vienna. Other materials from this course can be found [here](https://github.com/hydrosoc/rhydro_EGU18)

It further doubles as a permanently citable repository (DOI: **X:Y**) to complement the supplementary material (SM) of Slater *et al.* (in prep.). 
This was deemed necessary, as some additional files are required to reproduce the tutorial - the SM version is hence rather provided for illustrative (and educational) purposes.
