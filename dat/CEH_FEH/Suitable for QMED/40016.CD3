STATION,Asymmetrical compound Crump profile weir. Upper crest vandalised 2012 so data above 0.35cumecs (after November 2012) are estimated. GENERAL: Asymmetrical compound Crump profile weir; left bank weir width 3.052m, right bank weir width 7.612 m. The weirs are separated by a 0.23m wide concrete wall and are both contained within wing walls. Located in a very straight reach with some bank encroachment especially in weeded section immediately upstream of the tapping pipe outlet. STATION HYDROMETRY: Crest tapping on lower flow section. Modular limit ~6 cumecs, occasional drowning. Conforms to British Standard. Upper crest vandalised Nov 2012 and replaced to a lesser temporary standard due to pending site refurbishment. Until that work is completed, data quality is considered to be: Stage 0-0.15m: Good data, >0.15m: Estimated data (carries an unknown degree of error due to condition of upper crest). Significant bypassing rare. Weed growth can be a problem. Significant structural instability is an issue. Theoretical rating applied across period of record and extends to top of wing walls. No gaugings above 0.2m to confirm rating. The right bank floodplain is of a lower elevation than the weir crest, however the limits of sections taken up to 840m upstream indicate that no significant bypassing would occur under most flows. FLOW RECORD: Missing data in 2015 due to station re-build. FLOW REGIME: Major baseflow component but responsive to storms. Flows are substantially affected by artificial influences; surface and groundwater abstractions, storm water overflows and extensive local gravel workings. Considerable net export of water & diminution of runoff. River flows in alluvial tract which has been widely exploited for gravel/sand.
CATCHMENT,A mainly pervious (Chalk) catchment; the Cray flows in an alluvial tract which has been widely exploited for gravel/sand. Urban land use is extensive and increasing particularly in the lower catchment. Urban land use is significant. Chalk outcrops over a quarter of the area and is covered by permeable drift deposits, producing little or no surface runoff. Lower London Tertiaries comprising Blackheath Beds, Woolwich Beds, London Clay & Thanet Sands, overlie the chalk in the northern basin, occupying around half of the area. These are relatively impermeable deposits, producing some runoff. Mostly pervious catchment. The river appears as chalk springs in Orpington 8km north of the gauging station. During prolonged dry periods the flow virtually ceases.
Qmed Suitability,Theoretical rating judged to apply beyond QMED, although unverified by gaugings
Pooling Suitability,Theoretical rating doesnâ€™t adjust for drowning and by-passing which is known to affect higher flows
